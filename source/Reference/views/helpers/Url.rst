.. php:class:: Omeka_View_Helper_Url

extends :php:class:`Zend_View_Helper_Abstract`

    .. php:method:: url($options = array(), $name = null, $queryParams = array(), $reset = false, $encode = true)

        Generate a URL for use in one of Omeka's view templates.

        There are two ways to use this method.  The first way is for backwards
        compatibility with older versions of Omeka as well as ease of use for
        theme writers.

        Here is an example of what URLs are generated by calling the function in
        different ways. The output from these examples assume that Omeka is
        running on the root of a particular domain, though that is of no
        importance to how the function works.

        <code>
        echo $this->url('items/browse');
        // outputs "/items/browse"

        echo $this->url('items/browse', array('tags'=>'foo'));
        // outputs "/items/browse?tags=foo"

        echo $this->url(array('controller'=>'items', 'action'=>'browse'));
        // outputs "/items/browse"

        echo $this->url(
        array('controller'=>'items', 'action'=>'browse'),
        'otherRoute',
        array('tags'=>'foo'),
        );
        // outputs "/miscellaneous?tags=foo"
        </code>

        The first example takes a URL string exactly as one would expect it to be.
        This primarily exists for ease of use by theme writers. The second example
        appends a query string to the URL by passing it as an array. Note that in
        both examples, the first string must be properly URL-encoded in order to
        work. url('foo bar') would not work because of the space.

        In the third example, the URL is being built directly from parameters
        passed to it. For more details on this, please see the Zend Framework's
        documentation.

        In the last example, 'otherRoute' is the name of the route being used, as
        defined either in the routes.ini file or via a plugin. For examples of how
        to add routes via a plugin, please see Omeka's documentation.

        :type $options: string|array
        :param $options:
        :type $name: string|null|array
        :param $name: Optional If $options is an array, $name should be the route name (string) or null. If $options is a string, $name should be the set of query string parameters (array) or null.
        :type $queryParams: array
        :param $queryParams: Optional Set of query string parameters.
        :type $reset: bool
        :param $reset: Optional Whether or not to reset the route parameters implied by the current request, e.g. if the current controller is 'items', then 'controller'=>'items' will be inferred when assembling the route.
        :type $encode: bool
        :param $encode:
        :returns: string
