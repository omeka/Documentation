Helping With Documentation
##########################

We always appreciate help correcting and filling out stubs in our documentation. You can submit
contribute and make pull requests by clicking the "Edit on GitHub" link on any of the documentation
pages. Check the `README on the documentation GitHub repo <https://github.com/omeka/Documentation>`_ for details.

From our forums and a developer survey, we know that the biggest thing that will help the
community of Omeka developers is example code, especially code that fills out the documentation
for Global (Theming) Functions. Those files are located under ``libraries/globals/examples``. Each
file there corresponds to an Omeka global function that has automatically generated documentation.

*****************
Function Examples
*****************

If you would like to contribute how you have used or modified one of the Omeka globals functions, 
you can use the :ref:`exampletemplate` file as a starting point. Also, look at 
the `Metadata <https://github.com/omeka/Documentation/blob/master/source/Reference/libraries/globals/examples/metadata.rst>`_ 
file as a working sample. Just branch the corresponding file within GitHub 
(or create your own local copy), fill in the details of what you did, and submit a new pull request.

***************
Recipe Examples
***************

A second, broader, need is for recipes that fill out larger tasks. A recipe might combine several
functions or plugin structures to solve a large task.
These are found under ``Tutorials/recipes``. New ones can also be added via pull request.
There is also a :ref:`recipetemplate` for these, but the structure you use can follow whatever structures explain the process best.
Here is an example for `Retaining Search Order <https://github.com/omeka/Documentation/blob/master/source/Tutorials/recipes/retainingSearchSortOrderWhenPaging.rst>`_.
