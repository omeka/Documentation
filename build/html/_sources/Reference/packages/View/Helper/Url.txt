.. php:class:: Omeka_View_Helper_Url

    Package: :doc:`View\\Helper </Reference/packages/View/Helper/index>`

    .. php:method:: url($options = Array, $name, $queryParams = Array, $reset = , $encode = 1)
    
        Generate a URL for use in one of Omeka's view templates.
        
        There are two ways to use this method.  The first way is for backwardscompatibility with older versions of Omeka as
        well as ease of use fortheme writers.
        
        Here is an example of what URLs are generated by calling the function indifferent ways. The output from these
        examples assume that Omeka isrunning on the root of a particular domain, though that is of noimportance to how the
        function works.
        
        	               
        
        .. code-block:: php 
        
        
        	               echo $this->url('items/browse');
        	               // outputs "/items/browse"
        
        
        echo $this->url('items/browse', array('tags'=>'foo'));
        // outputs "/items/browse?tags=foo"
        
        echo $this->url(array('controller'=>'items', 'action'=>'browse'));
        // outputs "/items/browse"
        
        echo $this->url(array('controller'=>'items', 'action'=>'browse'),'otherRoute',array('tags'=>'foo'),);// outputs
        "/miscellaneous?tags=foo"</code>
        
        The first example takes a URL string exactly as one would expect it tobe. This primarily exists for ease of use by
        theme writers. The secondexample appends a query string to the URL by passing it as an array. Notethat in both
        examples, the first string must be properly URL-encoded inorder to work. url('foo bar') would not work because of
        the space.
        
        In the third example, the URL is being built directly from parameterspassed to it. For more details on this, please
        see the Zend Framework'sdocumentation.
        
        In the last example, 'otherRoute' is the name of the route being used, asdefined either in the routes.ini file or
        via a plugin. For examples ofhow to add routes via a plugin, please see Omeka's documentation.
